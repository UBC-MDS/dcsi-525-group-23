# DSCI 525 Group 23 Project
This group project is a part of the course DSCI_525 Web and Cloud Computing in MDS program - cohort 2021-2022 at University of British Columbia.

The purpose of the course is to teach students various ways to deal with "Big Data" from understanding dimensions of Big Data, learning how to store and process Big Data, using AWS cloud solutions and ultimately building and deploying ensemble machine learning models in the cloud.

## Overview
The project is divided into 4 milestones, in which we will sequentially take on the roles of Data Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer, and Data Scientist.

Each milestone is detailed as follows:
- Milestone 1: Get the data from web using API, process it, and convert it to an efficient file format.
- Milestone 2: Move the data to cloud, setup the infrastructure in the cloud and build a Machine Learning model.
- Milestone 3: Setup distributed infrastructure using Spark and run the Machine Learning model on Spark.
- Milestone 4: Deploy Machine Learning model in cloud so that other consumers can use it.

## Data
The data is from [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681) about `daily rainfall in Australia`(5.7 GB).

## Report
All reports are stored in `notebooks` directory.

- Milestone 1: A summary of observations on challenges encountered while exploring different options to tackle big data local laptops., is documented in this [notebook_1](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-525-group-23/blob/3ed57be059022a119dc940486ab6554c32ea4d26/notebooks/milestone_1.ipynb).

- Milestone 2: Setting up cloud instance, JupyterHub and server, moving data to s3 bucket and wrangling data for machine learning. This process is documented in this [notebook2](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-525-group-23/blob/dev/notebooks/milestone_2.ipynb)

- Milestone 3:

- Milestone 4:
